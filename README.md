Assignment 3
The Variable is the Number of searches, Variable Name Searches, Measurement Unit- Numeric, Allowed Values 0-999, Description: how many times in a month Lebron James has been looked up on Google.
The data is collected by Google from Google's Trends page. It is collected every day by the number of Web Searchs from that day
This data intrigues me because I am a very big LeBron fan, and I wanted to know how often someone that famous is being looked up. I looked him up many times before, so I wanted to see what everyone else in the US is doing.
